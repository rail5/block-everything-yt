# block_everything_yt
Firefox addon that blocks manipulative elements on YouTube


Originally forked from mverleg's "Block Comments"

Honestly, this is just the way that *I, personally,* prefer to browse YouTube. Most people would probably rather have the original mverleg addon ( https://github.com/mverleg/block_comments ), or my "Block YT Comments And Ratings" ( https://github.com/rail5/block_comments )

This addon blocks anything which I feel is primarily an attempt to influence the way we *feel* about what we're seeing. It blocks: comments, ratings, view counts, subscriber counts, and "official" propaganda "warnings" under different news media (*X organization is good, Y organization is bad*).

**To install,** compress these files into a .zip folder (with manifest.json at the **root** of the .zip folder, go to *about:addons* and click *"Install addon from file"*, and select the .zip folder
