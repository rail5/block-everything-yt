# block_everything_yt
Firefox addon that blocks manipulative elements on YouTube

**Note**

This addon is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain, given YouTube's ongoing transition to "web application" rather than "website" format. At this point, I'd really recommend using an alternative YT front-end -- although on that note, I feel that Invidious and FreeTube are deeply deficient, at least regarding customizability (hiding comments, ratings, view counts, etc)

**Addon info**

Originally forked from mverleg's "Block Comments"

This addon blocks anything which is primarily, rather than *content*, something to influence the way we *feel* about what we're seeing. It blocks: comments, ratings, view counts, subscriber counts, "official" "warnings" under news media (*X organization is good, Y organization is bad*, based on whether the US is friendly with that country or not), and indiscriminately-pushed political campaigns hosted on the homepage.

**To install:** 

*From this repo (latest version):*
Compress these files into a .zip folder (with manifest.json at the **root** of the .zip folder), go to *about:addons* in *Firefox Developer Edition* and click *"Install addon from file"*, and select the .zip folder

*From Mozilla:*

Some people might rather have the original mverleg addon, which only blocks comments under videos ( https://github.com/mverleg/block_comments )
